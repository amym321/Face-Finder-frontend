## Challenge  

Create an app utilizing an image recognition API, allow users to register and sign-in, and keep count of images.

## Solution

A react app was utilized to provide a front-end interface as well as a backend server. The database with 2 login tables was created with PostgreSQL. The frontend loads images and collects register/sign-in information. The backend routes sign-in information to the database and API responses. The server was built with Node for non-blocking runtime, and Express for http requests.

## Result

What resulted was a stylish frontend with full encryption for user login. Based on a class project.
